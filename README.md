# dataDigger

### A data explorer for [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro)

This project is developing a hierarchical browser, similar to the standard `findFile` command, but for digging through hierarchical data structures.  For example, you can give it `globals` and start with all global variables.
